      <t>This document extends the Resource-Oriented Lightweight
        Information Exchange (ROLIE) core to add the information type
        categories and related requirements needed to support Computer
        Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) use cases. The indicator
        and incident information types are defined as ROLIE extensions.
        Additional supporting requirements are also defined that describe
        the use of specific formats and link relations pertaining to the
        new information types.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="starting-intro">
      <t>Threats to computer security are evolving ever more rapidly as
        time goes on. As software increases in complexity, the number of
        vulnerabilities in systems and networks can increase
        exponentially. Threat actors looking to exploit these
        vulnerabilities are making more frequent and more widely
        distributed attacks across a large variety of systems. The
        adoption of liberal information sharing amongst attackers allows
        a discovered vulnerability to be shared and used to attack a
        vulnerable system within a narrow window of time. As the skills
        and knowledge required to identify and combat these attacks
        become more and more specialized, even a well established and
        secure system may find itself unable to quickly respond to an
        incident. Effective identification of and response to a
        sophisticated attack requires open cooperation and collaboration
        between defending operators, software vendors, and end-users. To
        improve the timeliness of responses, automation must be used to
        acquire, contextualize, and put to use shared computer security
        information.</t>

      <t> CSIRTS share two primary forms of information: incidents and
        indicators. Using these forms of information, analysts are able
        to perform a wide range of activities both proactive and reactive
        to ensure the security of their systems. </t>
      <t>Incident information describes a cyber security incident. Such
        information may include attack characteristics, information about
        the attacker, and attack vector data. Sharing this information
        helps analysts within the sharing community to inoculate their
        systems against similar attacks, providing proactive
        protection.</t>

      <t>Indicator information describes the symptoms or necessary
        pre-conditions of an attack. Everything from system
        vulnerabilities to unexpected network traffic can help analysts
        secure systems and prepare for an attack. Making this information
        available for sharing aids in the proactive defense of systems
        both within an operating unit but also for any CSIRTs that are
        part of a sharing consortium.</t>

      <t>As a means to bring automation of content discovery and
        dissemination into the CSIRT domain, this specification provides
        an extension to the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information
        Exchange (ROLIE) core <xref target="I-D.ietf-mile-rolie"/>
        designed to address CSIRT use cases. The primary purpose of this
        extension is to define two new information types: incident, and
        indicator, along with formats and link relations that support
        these information-types.</t>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="ext-terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL
        NOT," "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target="RFC2119"/>. </t>
      <t>Definitions for some of the common computer security-related
        terminology used in this document can be found in Section 2 of
        <xref target="RFC5070"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="New information-types" anchor="infotypes">
      <t>This document defines the following two information types:</t>
      <section title="The &quot;incident&quot; information type"
        anchor="infotype-incident">
        <t>The &quot;incident&quot; information type represents any
          information describing or pertaining to a computer security
          incident. This document uses the definition of incident
          provided by <xref target="RFC4949"/>. Provided below is a
          non-exhaustive list of information that may be considered to be
          an incident information type. <list style="symbols">
          <t>Timing information: start and end times for the incident
            and/or the response.</t>
          <t>Descriptive information: plain text or machine readable data
            that provides some degree of description of the incident
            itself.</t>
          <t>Response information: the methods and results of a response
            to the incident.</t>
          <t>Meta and contact information: data about the CSIRT that
            recorded the information, or the operator that enacted the
            response.</t>
          <t>Effect and result information: data that describes the
            effects of an incident, or what the final results of the
            incident are.</t>
          </list> </t>
        <t>Note again that this list is not exhaustive, any information
          that in is the abstract realm of an incident should be
          classified under this information-type.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="The &quot;indicator&quot; information type"
        anchor="infotype-indicator">
        <t> The &quot;indicator&quot; information type represents
          computer security indicators or any information surrounding
          them. This document uses the definition of indicator provided
          by <xref target="RFC4949"/>. Some examples of indicator
          information is provided below, but note that indicator is
          defined in an abstract sense, to be understood as a flexible
          and widely-applicable definition. <list style="symbols">
          <t>Specific vulnerabilities that indicate a vector for
            attack.</t>
          <t>Signs of malicious reconnaissance.</t>
          <t>Definitions of patterns of other indicators.</t>
          <t>Events that may indicate an attack and information regarding
            those events.</t>
          <t>Meta information about the collecting agent.</t>
          </list> </t>
        <t>This list is intended to provide examples of the indicator
          information-type, not to define it.</t>

        <section title="IODEF Format" anchor="ext-synd-format-iodef">
          <t>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) is a

          <t>IODEF conveys indicators, incident reports, response
            activities, and related meta-data in an XML serialization.
            This information is formally structured in order to support
            and encourage automated machine-to-machine security
            communication, as well as enhanced processing at the

            &lt;rolie:property&gt; element with the following
            requirements:</t>
          <t>The "name" attribute is
            urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:csirt:id.</t>
          <t>The "value" attribute SHOULD be established via the
            concatenation of the value of the name attribute from the
            IODEF &lt;IncidentID&gt; element and the corresponding value
            of the &lt;IncidentID&gt; element. This requirement ensures a
            simple and direct one-to-one relationship between an IODEF
            incident ID and a corresponding Feed entry ID and avoids the
            need for any system to maintain a persistent store of these
            identity mappings. </t>

        <section title="User Authorization" anchor="normative-user-authz">
          <t>When the content model for the Atom &lt;content&gt; element
            of an Atom Entry contains an &lt;IODEF-Document&gt;, then
            authorization MUST be adjudicated based upon the Atom
            &lt;category&gt; element(s), whose values have been mapped as
            per <xref target="iodefcategory"/>. </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Expectation and Impact Classes"
          anchor="normative-expectation-impact">
          <t>It is frequently the case that an organization will need to
            triage their investigation and response activities based
            upon, e.g., the state of the current threat environment, or
            simply as a result of having limited resources. </t>
          <t> In order to enable operators to effectively prioritize
            their response activity, it is RECOMMENDED that feed
            implementers provide Atom categories that correspond to the
            IODEF Expectation and Impact classes. The availability of
            these feed categories will enable clients to more easily
            retrieve and prioritize cyber security information that has
            already been identified as having a specific potential
            impact, or having a specific expectation. </t>
          <t> Support for these categories may also enable efficiencies
            for organizations that already have established (or plan to
            establish) operational processes and workflows that are based
            on these IODEF classes. </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Search">
          <t> Implementers SHOULD support search based upon the IODEF
            AlternativeID class as a search parameter. </t>
          <t> Implementers SHOULD support search based upon the four
            timestamp elements of the IODEF Incident class:
            &lt;startTime&gt;, &lt;EndTime&gt;, &lt;DetectTime&gt;, and
            &lt;ReportTime&gt;. </t>
          <t> Implementers MAY support additional search capabilities
            based upon any of the remaining elements of the IODEF
            Incident class, including the &lt;Description&gt; element. </t>
          <t> Collections that support use of the RID schema as a content
            model in the Atom member entry &lt;content&gt; element (e.g.
            in a report resource representation reachable via the
            "report" link relationship) MUST support search operations
            that include the RID MessageType as a search parameter, in
            addition to the aforementioned IODEF schema elements, as
            contained within the &lt;ReportSchema&gt; element. </t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document implies the use of ROLIE in high-security use
        cases, as such, added care should be taken to fortify and secure
        ROLIE repositories and clients using this extension. The guidance
        in the ROLIE core specification is strongly recommended, and
        implementers should consider adding additional security measures
        as they see fit.</t>
      <t>When providing a private workspace for closed sharing, it is
        recommended that the ROLIE repository checks user authorization
        when the user sends a GET request to the service document. If the
        user is not authorized to send any requests to a given workspace
        or collection, that workspace or collection should be truncated
        from the service document in the response. In this way the
        existence of unauthorized content remains unknown to potential
        attackers, hopefully reducing attack surface.</t>

    <section title="Non-Normative Examples" anchor="non-norm-ex">
      <t>The following provide examples of some potential use cases of
        the CSIRT ROLIE extension, and provides a showcase for some of
        its benefits over traditional solutions.
      </t>
      <t>The general non-normative examples provided in the core ROLIE
        document remain an excellent reference resource for typical ROLIE
      usage.</t>
      <section title="Use of Link Relations" anchor="link-relations">
        <t> A key benefit of using the RESTful architectural style is the
          ability to enable the client to navigate to related resources
          through the use of hypermedia links. In the Atom Syndication
          Format, the type of the related resource identified in a
          &lt;link&gt; element is indicated via the "rel" attribute,
          where the value of this attribute identifies the kind of
          related resource available at the corresponding "href"
          attribute. Thus, in lieu of a well-known URI template the URI
          itself is effectively opaque to the client, and therefore the
          client must understand the semantic meaning of the "rel"
          attribute in order to successfully navigate. Broad
          interoperability may be based upon a sharing consortium
          defining a well-known set of Atom Link Relation types. These
          Link Relation types may either be registered with IANA, or held
          in a private registry. </t>
        <t> Individual CSIRTs may always define their own link relation
          types in order to support specific use cases, however support
          for a core set of well-known link relation types is encouraged
          as this will maximize interoperability. </t>
        <t> In addition, it may be beneficial to define use case profiles
          that correspond to specific groupings of supported link
          relationship types. In this way, a CSIRT may unambiguously
          specify the classes of use cases for which a client can expect
          to find support. </t>
        <t> The following sections provide non-normative examples of link
          relation usage. Three distinct cyber security information
          sharing use case scenarios are described. In each use case, the
          unique benefits of adopting a resource-oriented approach to
          information sharing are illustrated. It is important to note
          that these use cases are intended to be a small representative
          set and is by no means meant to be an exhaustive list. The
          intent is to illustrate how the use of link relationship types
          will enable this resource-oriented approach to cyber security
          information sharing to successfully support the complete range
          of existing use cases, and also to motivate an initial list of
          well-defined link relationship types. </t>
        <section title="Use Case: Incident Sharing" anchor="info-share">
          <t> This section provides a non-normative example of an
            incident sharing use case. </t>
          <t> In this use case, a member CSIRT shares incident
            information with another member CSIRT in the same consortium.
            The client CSIRT retrieves a feed of incidents, and is able
            to identify one particular entry of interest. The client then
            does an HTTP GET on that entry, and the representation of
            that resource contains link relationships for both the
            associated "indicators" and the incident "history", and so
            on. The client CSIRT recognizes that some of the indicator
            and history may be relevant within her local environment, and
            can respond proactively. </t>

          <t> In this use case, two member CSIRTs that belong to a closed
            sharing consortium are collaborating on an incident
            investigation. The initiating CSIRT performs an HTTP GET to
            retrieve the service document of the peer CSIRT, and
            determines the collection name to be used for creating a new
            investigation request. The initiating CSIRT then POSTs a new
            incident entry to the appropriate collection URL. The target

          <t>This section provides a non-normative example of a cyber
            security data repository use case. </t>
          <t> In this use case a client accesses a persistent repository
            of cyber security data via a RESTful usage model. Retrieving
            a feed collection is analogous to an SQL SELECT statement
            producing a result set. Retrieving an individual Atom Entry
            is analogous to a SQL SELECT statement based upon a primary
            key producing a unique record. The cyber security data
            contained in the repository may include different data types,
            including indicators, incidents, benchmarks, or any other
            related resources. In this use case, the repository is
            queried via HTTP GET, and the results that are returned to
            the client may optionally contain URL references to other
            cyber security resources that are known to be related. These
            related resources may also be persisted locally, or they may
            exist at another (remote) cyber data respository. </t>
          <t>Example HTTP GET request to a persistent repository for any
            resources representing Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)
            attacks:</t>

          </figure>
          <t>The corresponding HTTP response would be an XML document
            containing the DDOS feed.</t>

          <t>This feed document has two atom entries, one of which has
            been elided. The completed entry illustrates an Atom
            &lt;entry&gt; element that provides a summary of essential
            details about one particular DDOS incident. Based upon this
            summary information and the provided category information, a
            client may choose to do an HTTP GET operation to retrieve the
            full details of the DDOS incident. This example shows how a
            persistent repository may provide links to additional
            resources, both local and remote.</t>
          <t>Note that the provider of a persistent repostory is not
            obligated to follow any particular URL template scheme. The
            repository available at the hypothetical provider
            "www.example.com" uses a different URL pattern than the
            hypothetical repository available at "www.cyber-agency.gov".
            When a client de-references a link to resource that is
            located in a remote repository the client may be challenged
            for authentication credentials acceptable to that provider.
            If the two repository providers choose to support a federated
            identity scheme or some other form of single-sign-on
            technology, then the user experience can be improved for
            interactive clients (e.g., a human user at a browser).
            However, this is not required and is an implementation choice
            that is out of scope for this specification. </t>
