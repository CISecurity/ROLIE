      <t>This document extends the ROLIE core to support a number of
        information types needed to support Computer Security Incident
        Response Team (CSIRT) use cases. To address these use cases, this

        over what is defined in the ROLIE core, and provides examples of
        using ROLIE to facilitate CSIRT information exchanges.</t>

      <t>This specification is an extension to the ROLIE core <xref target="rolie"/> designed to address CSIRT use cases. This
        document provides both examples and requirements for
        implementations support CSIRT use cases. This document is divided
        into three sections: motivation and background, guidance and
        examples, and normative requirements.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL
        NOT," "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target="RFC2119"/>. </t>

    <section title="Motivation for CISRT ROLIE Implementations">
      <t>Threat actors have established vast networks of information
        sharing amongst themselves. Exploits and vulnerabilities are
        distributed rapidly after discovery, and an attack on one system
        often indicates similar attacks are impending on other systems.
        Incident reports collected on one system may provide useful
        insight on these impending attacks, but reliance on
        point-to-point messaging systems hinders automatic public
        distribution of potentially valuable information. In this way,
        operators are isolated in ways that threat actors are not.</t>
      <t>ROLIE provides a lightweight information exchange that seeks to
        facilitate rapid and automated communication of computer security
        information. By adopting a RESTful solution, ROLIE allows the
        creation of information repositories that can make feeds of data
        available. Consumers and operators may make inferences based on
        this information, and then make this new insight available on
        their own ROLIE repositories.</t>
      <t>This system of sharing made possible by ROLIE creates an open
        forum of security collaboration, reducing duplication of efforts.

      <section title="The IODEF Format">
        <section title="Background">
          <t>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) is a
            format for representing computer security information
            commonly exchanged between Computer Security Incident
            Response Teams (CSIRTs) or other operational security teams. </t>
          <t>IODEF conveys indicators, incident reports, response
            activities, and related meta-data in an XML serialization.
            This information is formally structured in order to support
            and encourage automated machine-to-machine security
            communication, as well as enhanced processing at the
            endpoint.</t>
          <t>The full IODEF specification provides further high-level
            discussion and technical details.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Motivation for Integration in ROLIE">
          <t>IODEF's goals as a format specification aligns closely with
            ROLIE's goals as a exchange specification. Both strive to
            create a security automation ecosystem that is built on a
            foundation of open communication and interoperability.</t>
          <t>Any stakeholder current supporting the IODEF format and
            sharing IODEF information by some mechanism benefits greatly
            by adopting a standardized information sharing scheme. ROLIE
            provides a means to easily share and acquire IODEF
            information as well asa way to append any additional metadata
            that could be useful to operations.</t>
          <t>Any current ROLIE implementation would be motivated to adopt
            this extension in order to support existing CSIRTs and other
            operators that utilize the IODEF format.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="The STIX Format">
        <section title="Background">
          <t>STIX is a structured language for describing a wide range of
            security resources. STIX approaches the problem with a focus
            on flexibility, automatability, readability, and
            extensibility. TODO </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Motivation for Integration in ROLIE">
          <t>STIX strives to create a structured format of information to
            aid communication between sharing security entities both
            externally and internally. STIX is a valuable format to
            support in a ROLIE implementation in order to support CSIRTs
            and other security stakeholders that utilize the standard.

    <section title="Non-Normative Examples" anchor="non-norm-ex">
      <section title="Use of Link Relations" anchor="link-relations">
        <t> A key benefit of using the RESTful architectural style is the
          ability to enable the client to navigate to related resources
          through the use of hypermedia links. In the Atom Syndication
          Format, the type of the related resource identified in a
          &lt;link&gt; element is indicated via the "rel" attribute,
          where the value of this attribute identifies the kind of
          related resource available at the corresponding "href"
          attribute. Thus, in lieu of a well-known URI template the URI
          itself is effectively opaque to the client, and therefore the
          client must understand the semantic meaning of the "rel"
          attribute in order to successfully navigate. Broad
          interoperability may be based upon a sharing consortium
          defining a well-known set of Atom Link Relation types. These
          Link Relation types may either be registered with IANA, or held
          in a private registry. <vspace blankLines="1"/> Individual
          CSIRTs may always define their own link relation types in order
          to support specific use cases, however support for a core set
          of well-known link relation types is encouraged as this will
          maximize interoperability. <vspace blankLines="1"/> In
          addition, it may be beneficial to define use case profiles that
          correspond to specific groupings of supported link relationship
          types. In this way, a CSIRT may unambiguously specify the
          classes of use cases for which a client can expect to find
          support. <vspace blankLines="1"/> The following sections
          provide non-normative examples of link relation usage. Three
          distinct cyber security information sharing use case scenarios
          are described. In each use case, the unique benefits of
          adopting a resource-oriented approach to information sharing
          are illustrated. It is important to note that these use cases
          are intended to be a small representative set and is by no
          means meant to be an exhaustive list. The intent is to
          illustrate how the use of link relationship types will enable
          this resource-oriented approach to cyber security information
          sharing to successfully support the complete range of existing
          use cases, and also to motivate an initial list of well-defined
          link relationship types. </t>
        <section title="Use Case: Incident Sharing" anchor="info-share">
          <t> This section provides a non-normative example of an
            incident sharing use case. <vspace blankLines="1"/> In this
            use case, a member CSIRT shares incident information with
            another member CSIRT in the same consortium. The client CSIRT
            retrieves a feed of incidents, and is able to identify one
            particular entry of interest. The client then does an HTTP
            GET on that entry, and the representation of that resource
            contains link relationships for both the associated
            "indicators" and the incident "history", and so on. The
            client CSIRT recognizes that some of the indicator and
            history may be relevant within her local environment, and can
            respond proactively. <figure height="" suppress-title="false" width="" alt="" title="" align="left">

        <section title="Use Case:  Cyber Data Repository" anchor="cyber-repo">
          <t>This section provides a non-normative example of a cyber
            security data repository use case. <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            In this use case a client accesses a persistent repository of
            cyber security data via a RESTful usage model. Retrieving a
            feed collection is analogous to an SQL SELECT statement
            producing a result set. Retrieving an individual Atom Entry
            is analogous to a SQL SELECT statement based upon a primary
            key producing a unique record. The cyber security data
            contained in the repository may include different data types,
            including indicators, incidents, becnmarks, or any other
            related resources. In this use case, the repository is
            queried via HTTP GET, and the results that are returned to
            the client may optionally contain URL references to other
            cyber security resources that are known to be related. These
            related resources may also be persisted locally, or they may
            exist at another (remote) cyber data respository. <figure height="" suppress-title="false" width="" alt="" title="" align="left">

            <postamble>This feed document has two atom entries, one of
              which has been elided. The completed entry illustrates an
              Atom &lt;entry&gt; element that provides a summary of
              essential details about one particular DDOS incident. Based
              upon this summary information and the provided category
              information, a client may choose to do an HTTP GET
              operation to retrieve the full details of the DDOS
              incident. This example shows how a persistent repository
              may provide links to additional resources, both local and
              remote. </postamble>
            </figure> Note that the provider of a persistent repostory is
            not obligated to follow any particular URL template scheme.
            The repository available at the hypothetical provider
            "www.example.com" uses a different URL pattern than the
            hypothetical repository available at "www.cyber-agency.gov".
            When a client de-references a link to resource that is
            located in a remote repository the client may be challenged
            for authentication credentials acceptable to that provider.
            If the two repository providers choose to support a federated
            identity scheme or some other form of single-sign-on
            technology, then the user experience can be improved for
            interactive clients (e.g., a human user at a browser).
            However, this is not required and is an implementation choice
            that is out of scope for this specification. </t>

          payload data will be exposed outside of the payload. The
          majority of these requirements hinge on this and are subject to
          change as this document moves forward.</t>

            element is constrained as per section 3.2 of IODEF, e.g.
            traceback, mitigation, reporting, or other. A collection
            containing IODEF incident content MUST contain a
            &lt;ROLIE-CSIRT:restriction&gt; element. The allowable
            content for the element is constrained as per section 3.2 of
            IODEF, e.g. public, need-to-know, private, default. When the
            category scheme="purpose", the allowable values for the
            "term" attribute are constrained as per section 3.2 of IODEF,
            e.g. traceback, mitigation, reporting, other. This metadata
            provides valuable metadata for searching and organization.

            &lt;IncidentID&gt; element and the corresponding value of the
            &lt;IncidentID&gt; element. This requirement ensures a simple
            and direct one-to-one relationship between an IODEF incident
            ID and a corresponding Feed entry ID and avoids the need for
            any system to maintain a persistent store of these identity
            mappings. <vspace blankLines="1"/> (todo: Note that this
            implies a constraint on the IODEF document that is more
            restrictive than the current IODEF schema. IODEF section 3.3
            requires only that the name be a STRING type. Here we are
            stating that name must be an IRI. Possible request to update

          In order to enable operators to effectively prioritize their
          response activity, it is RECOMMENDED that feed implementers
          provide Atom categories that correspond to the IODEF
          Expectation and Impact classes. The availability of these feed
          categories will enable clients to more easily retrieve and
          prioritize cyber security information that has already been
          identified as having a specific potential impact, or having a
          specific expectation. <vspace blankLines="1"/> Support for
